Overview
This dataset provides comprehensive information on water management metrics in various regions of Nigeria, with a focus on Non-Revenue Water (NRW). NRW refers to water that is produced but not billed to customers due to various reasons such as leaks, theft, and metering inaccuracies. The dataset contains multiple features that capture environmental, infrastructural, and operational factors influencing NRW levels.

Dataset Features
The dataset includes the following features:

Date: The specific date of the recorded data entry (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
Region: The geographical area where the data was collected (e.g., North, South, East, West).
Temperature (°C): The ambient temperature recorded in the region on the given date, measured in degrees Celsius.
Precipitation (mm): The amount of rainfall recorded in the region on the given date, measured in millimeters.
Population: The estimated population of the region, affecting water demand and consumption, measured in number of people.
Infrastructure Age (years): The age of the water distribution infrastructure in the region, measured in years.
Pipe Diameter (cm): The diameter of the water pipes used in the region's distribution system, measured in centimeters.
Pipe Material: The material of the pipes used in the water distribution system (e.g., PVC, Copper, Steel).
Maintenance Records: The number of maintenance activities recorded for the water distribution infrastructure.
Water Source: The primary source of water supply in the region (e.g., Groundwater, Reservoir Supply, Surface Water).
Water Loss Detection Method: The technology or method used to detect water loss in the distribution system (e.g., Acoustic sensor).
Water Leakage (count): The number of detected water leakages in the region.
Leakage Detected (Boolean): Indicates whether any leakage was detected (True/False).
Metering Accuracy (%): The accuracy of water meters in the region, measured as a percentage.
Water Pressure (bars): The pressure of water in the distribution system, measured in bars.
Pump Operations (count): The number of pump operations conducted, indicating the activity level of water pumps.
Water Volume Produced (m³): The total volume of water produced by the water utility in the region, measured in cubic meters.
Water Volume Billed (m³): The total volume of water billed to customers, measured in cubic meters.
Non-Revenue Water (NRW) (m³): The volume of water produced but not billed to customers, representing losses, measured in cubic meters.
Usage
This dataset is intended for research and analysis purposes, particularly in the context of water management and NRW reduction. Researchers and data scientists can use this dataset to:

Analyze the factors contributing to NRW in different regions of Nigeria.
Develop and evaluate machine learning models to forecast NRW levels.
Explore the impact of environmental and infrastructural variables on water distribution efficiency.
Design and implement strategies to reduce NRW and improve water utility performance.
